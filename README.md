**Note:** This project is a fork of opentelemetry-demo. A big thanks to the original team and contributors for open-sourcing such an excellent demo â€” it's truly one of the best resources available online.

## Welcome to the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop Demo

This repository contains the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop, a microservice-based
distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in
a near real-world environment.

The goals of this project are threefold:

- Provide a realistic example of a distributed system that can be used to
  demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability.
- Build a base for vendors, tooling authors, and others to extend and
  demonstrate their OpenTelemetry integrations.
- Create a living example for OpenTelemetry contributors to use for testing new
  versions of the API, SDK, and other components or enhancements.


## Quick start

You can be up and running with the demo in a few minutes. Check out the docs for
your preferred deployment method:

- [Docker](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/docker_deployment/)
- [Kubernetes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/kubernetes_deployment/)
